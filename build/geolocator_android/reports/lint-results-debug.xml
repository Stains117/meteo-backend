        priority="9"
        summary="Missing Permissions"
        explanation="This check scans through your code and libraries and looks at the APIs being used, and checks this against the set of permissions required to access those APIs. If the code using those APIs is called at runtime, then the program will crash.&#xA;&#xA;Furthermore, for permissions that are revocable (with `targetSdkVersion` 23), client code must also be prepared to handle the calls throwing an exception if the user rejects the request for permission at runtime."

        severity="Warning"
        message="Use of this function is discouraged because resource reflection makes it harder to perform build optimizations and compile-time verification of code. It is much more efficient to retrieve resources by identifier (e.g. `R.foo.bar`) than by name (e.g. `getIdentifier(&quot;bar&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, null)`)."

        priority="6"
        summary="Static Field Leaks"
        explanation="A static field will leak contexts.&#xA;&#xA;Non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to their outer class. If that outer class is for example a `Fragment` or `Activity`, then this reference means that the long-running handler/loader/task will hold a reference to the activity which prevents it from getting garbage collected.&#xA;&#xA;Similarly, direct field references to activities and fragments from these longer running instances can cause leaks.&#xA;&#xA;ViewModel classes should never point to Views or non-application Contexts."
